She's #r@rough@ around the #r@edges@ and prideful, but it seems she cares more than she lets on. NL Luckily, you've kept enough #yBone #yFragments in your pocket to ask for her help, but you might need to ask if she has anything #yspecial ~hidden~ ~up~ ~her~ ~abdomen~ this time.",
      "No sooner than you speak does everything go #p~dark~ . You can feel the silk ~wriggling~ into the very #y@core@ of your being, filling you with #g~skills~ , #r~power~ , #b~knowledge~ , and #p~concentration~ from places #y~unknown~ . And as soon as you realize, it stops - and Arachne is back to ~idly~ ~ignoring~ ~you~ as if she hadn't moments ago reshaped your very being.",
      "She's already moved on to ~pretending~ to ignore you. She seems #yglad that you're strong enough to manage on your own, but ~slightly~ #ybitter that you denied her help. You're surprised there was no #r@vicious@ #r@mockery@ .",
